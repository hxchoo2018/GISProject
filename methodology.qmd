# Methodology

## 1. Calculation using Origin-Destination Matrix (OD-Matrix)

First we extract MasterPlan 14 Subzone (no sea) and export it into a GeoPackage. We also add in the education layer, after filtering Junior Colleges, Mixed Levels and Institutions, using the 'filter by expression' function into QGIS and export this layer to GeoPackage.

The roads layer from the OSM data is also added onto the panel. The roads layer is then clipped together with MasterPlan 14, to get roads that are within Singapore. This newly created clipped layer is then exported as GeoPackage.

A hexagon layer, with the shape of MasterPlan 14 is also created using the 'Create Grids' function. The hexagon is then computed as a hexagon centroid so as to 'convert' the polygon feature into a point feature which could then be runned by QNEAT3 for network analysis.

After using QNEAT3 for accessibility analysis, we would obtain an Output OD Matrix which shows the shortest path which is then categorised by a choropleth map.

## 2. Calculation on number of nearest bus stops, LRT and MRT station within 1km buffer region

A dissolved buffer region of 1 km with locations of Junior Colleges being the centre of the buffer region, using the 'buffer' function and exported as GeoPackage.

For bus stops, we would use the transport layer under OSM data, clip to filter transports within Singapore and further filter for bus stops. Lastly, to filter those bus stops within the 1 km buffer region.

Clip the LRT and MRT Exit (downloaded from data.gov) layer with the 1 km buffer region to get MRT and LRT stations within the 1 km buffer region.
