    "text": "To better identify the differences, we will be doing a comparison of Junior Colleges before the 2019 merger and after merger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the diagram, taking into account all the roads, we used QNEAT3 to analyse the accessibility. Choropleth map is then used for better comparison of distance between each individual hexagon to each Junior Colleges. The shortest distance between any of the hexagons selected as origin and merged Junior Colleges as the destination point is 256.6 metres, rounding up to 257 metres.\n\nMost of the hexagons are relatively in red or in different shades of red. This possibly suggests that most Junior Colleges are not that accessible as the shortest distance ranges from at least 6132 metres to 68963 metres.\n\n\n\n\nComparing both hexagons, we have identified the following differences. Few hexagons, only 7, in 2019 before merger are of a darker shade as compared after merger. Also, the closure of those Junior Colleges are mostly within 10 hexagons, which is about 2500 metres apart.\nAs such we can conclude that the merger of Junior Colleges does not really have a huge impact on accessibility. Comparing the histograms, it could be said that the general trend of the histograms are mostly similar, ranging from around 6100 metres to 69000 metres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt could be seen that all Junior Colleges have at least one or more bus stops within the 1 km buffer. Since it is noted that accessibility is closely related with the economic and social opportunities as well as development of that area, it is clear that Singapore's bus services could be deemed as quite well developed. This is because Singapore's bus services have been around since 1925, nearly a century ago.\n\nThe areas circled in yellow are areas of differences before (on the left) and after merger (on the right). We would be discussing only 2 of those areas (those circled in blue and red) since their 1 km buffer regions are overlapped. \nAs seen from the region circled in blue and red, before merger, one of the Junior Colleges does not have that many bus stops within the 1 km buffer region as compared to the other. As such, the school that has lesser bus stops is being merged together with the one that has a higher number of bus stops within the buffer region. This could possibly suggest that the merger of schools has allowed schools to be more accessible as compared to before. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, not all Junior Colleges have MRT stations within the 1 km buffer region, particularly, schools that are near the Downtown area and South of Singapore tend to have more than 1 MRT station nearby. A possible reason could be because those Junior Colleges are near the Central Business District where most people would come down for food, entertainment & Leisures and work. Since most people are situated there during normal day time, it is appropriate for the Government to have built that many MRT stations around.\n\nComparing both figures, the area circled in blue suggests that the Junior College that does not MRT within the 1 km buffer region is merged together with another school that has a closer MRT station. However, on the other hand, the regions circled in red seem to show that even if there is a MRT station within the 1 km buffer region, schools are still forced to be merged. This suggests a potential that the reason for certain schools being selected to be closed could be due to other factors such as availability of school resources.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a picture of Anderson Serangoon Junior College within 1 kilometre walking radius with a walking speed of 5m/s. There is also the fastest walking path of 6.3 minutes of walking time from the school to Yio Chu Kang MRT station."

    "text": "Singapore is well known for its high quality of education in the world, ranking higher than many other countries. In 2018, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) conducted a Global Competence test, as part of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Singapore students, aged 15 years old, claimed a top spot in the international test, scoring an average of 576 marks. Not only so, about 46 per cent of the Singapore students who took the test achieved the highest global competency proficiency levels (Singapore’s 15-Year-Olds Top OECD’s Pisa Global Competence Test, 2020). This clearly supports the fact that Singapore’s Education System has topped the education ranking and is looked up upon by many parents wishing to send their children into Singapore’s Education System.\n\nHowever, in 2017, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has announced 14 pairs of schools will be merged by 2019,with the already limited number of Junior Colleges (JC) also included. The reason behind this merger is due to Singapore’s declining birth rate (4 Pairs of JCs to Merge as Student Numbers Shrink; 14 Primary and 6 Secondary Schools Also Affected, 2017). The decline of birth rates affects the JC intake, which is expected to drop by a fifth, going from 16,000 in 2010 to 12,800 in 2019. This means some Junior College’s intake could fall to as low as 200 or 300 over the next few years. MOE also took into consideration to ensure the quality of the range of education programmes and co-curricular activities is maintained. Thus the merger/closure of JC would allow resources to be better diverted and utilised in more appropriate situations.\n\nWe will be focusing on the four tertiary Junior Colleges like Anderson JC, Yishun JC, Meridian JC and Pioneer JC as they are sites after the Junior College merger."

    "text": "Motivations\nOur group has decided to focus on the closure/merger of Junior Colleges because there are only a limited number of Junior Colleges, 22+4, in Singapore which offer either a 2-years GCE Advanced Level Programme or a 3-year International Baccalaureate Programme.\nThese pre-tertiary schools prepare students for the admission to Universities through a rigorous curriculum. It is also important to note that admission to Junior Colleges is not the only path to Universities. Singapore also has Polytechnics that offer a variety of vocational degrees to students who prefer a more flexible studying programme.\nHowever, there is still a stereotypical thinking that students who admit to Junior Colleges, typically have a higher admission rate as compared to those who go by the Polytechnic path. Henceforth, the announcement of merger/closure of Junior Colleges would result in more competitions between students who are looking to enter Junior Colleges. \nHence, our project aims to discover how the closure or merger of Junior Colleges and Mixed Institutions at the tertiary level would affect the equity of access. We will be evaluating the shortest distance and time taken between demand points and Junior Colleges (as supply points) as well as the number, time taken and distance of available Light Rapid Transit (LRT) and Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations within the 1 km buffer region of the schools. The reason why we considered only public transport, specifically MRT trains is because more people are taking trains and buses to commute to work as compared with a decade ago and only MRT trains datasets are available. We will then determine whether there should be a re-opening of those Junior Colleges which were previously merged, as a possible suggestion after taking all the factors into account."
